In my school we are programming this semester in uC32 arduino, but i can't find that chipkit anywhere near me, 
also i couln't find any simulators online, so i decided to make my own simulator, 
and of course all in good old console!  :D Still work in progres...

# Note that i probably won't be making full simulator, i will only be making the stuff i need for school.
Which is basically only L01-L08, SW1-SW4, BTN1-BTN4. 

Controls:
- 1,2,3,4 - SW1, SW2, SW3, SW4 (on/off)
- Q,W,E,R - BTN4, BTN3, BTN2, BTN1 (hold to on, release to off)
- LEDs are ordered in descending order from left to right L08,L07,...,L01
